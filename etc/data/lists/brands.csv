Kimberly Clark, GoodNites, GoodNites are absorbent disposable underwear manufactured by Kimberly Clark (makers of Huggies Diapers and Depend Briefs) made primarily for children and teens who still wet the bed at night. The ages average from 5 to 15 years of age (though smaller adults with a 36 inch waist or thinner can fit the larger ones as well). They can also be used for daytime protection as well. They all come in one absorbancy. They are ideal for children with "weak bladders" who feel the need to urinate frequently but cannot get to the bathroom as often as they need to. They hold up to a urination and a half. GoodNites go on and off like regular underwear but have the absorbancy of a diaper. They are not recommended for children who cannot feel the need to urinate or for fecal incontinence. They can be worn for long car trips or even to school for kids who are accident prone. This product is also popular among AB/DLs.
